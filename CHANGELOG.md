## [0.2.0] - 2021-12-20

### Added
- New __main__.py so the package can be executed from the command line.
- Quality of fit metrics (root mean square error, RMSE, and error rate, ER) for the 2D image fitting which are printed in verbose output and on the plot generated by the display_image_fits function.
- pandas dependency.
- missing scikit-image dependency in the install_requires list of setup.py.
- optional tqdm dependency to display progress bar when running from the command line.

### Changed
- Changed diffusionfit.Gaussian class to diffusionfit.GaussianFit.
- Updated the region width used by the DiffusionFitBase.fit function when estimating the signal. It now uses 5 pixel widths instead of 3.
- Changed the way the noise is estimated. It now takes the average over the absolute values in the noise region instead of the standard deviation.
- Line ROI estimation via the DiffusionFitBase.line_average function uses the minimum size dimension (x or y) of the image now instead of just computing over the x-dimension. This also affects the noise estimation as the noise is estimated on the tails of the Line ROI.


## [0.1.0] - 2021-12-19

### Added
- Initial development version with 2D Gaussian fitting.
